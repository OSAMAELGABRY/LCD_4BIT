# LCD_4BIT
This program for using LCD in 4 bit mode ,, the difference from 8 bit is that there is only 4 pins to send data or commands to LCD ,,
the idea is to send the 8 bits on two times "4 bit at time " (4 bit called nibble) "the code differs in sending command ,
data and Initialization functions " and the rest function remains the same there is unnoticeable latency
